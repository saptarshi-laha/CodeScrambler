# CodeScrambler

## Overview
CodeScrambler is a comprehensive mutation engine designed to complicate the analysis of binaries by introducing arbitrary jumps and injecting junk code. Built using Python, CodeScrambler aims to thwart static analysis without acting as a packing or crypting mechanism. It operates exclusively on executable sections, leaving plaintext data in non-executable sections untouched. For binary or string encryption, users should employ additional tools.

## Features
- **Obfuscation**: Introduces unnecessary code blocks and arbitrary jumps that do not affect the register or flag state, thereby adding complexity to static analysis without hindering the execution flow of binaries.
- **Compatibility**: Can be used in conjunction with packers and crypters to provide an additional layer of obfuscation.
- **Non-intrusive**: Focuses on executable sections, ensuring non-executable sections remain unaffected.

## Use Cases
- **Enhanced Security**: By adding an extra layer of obfuscation, CodeScrambler makes reverse engineering and static analysis more challenging for potential attackers.
- **Integration with Other Tools**: Works alongside existing packers and crypters to further obfuscate binaries, providing a multi-faceted approach to binary protection.

## Inspiration
The design and functionality of CodeScrambler are inspired by the VMProtect Mutation Engine, which is renowned for its robust obfuscation techniques.

## Installation
To install CodeScrambler, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can then clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
